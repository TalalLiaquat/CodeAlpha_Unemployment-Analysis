## 📚 Project Overview  

This project uses **real-world unemployment data** to:  
- Explore unemployment rate trends over time  
- Highlight the **economic effects of Covid-19**  
- Identify **seasonal patterns** in unemployment  
- Provide insights that could inform **economic and social policies**  

The project demonstrates the use of **Python for Data Analysis** with libraries like **Pandas** and **Matplotlib**.

## 🚀 Features  

✅ Load unemployment data from **CSV**  
✅ Clean and preprocess data  
✅ Visualize **unemployment rate trends** over time  
✅ Compare **yearly averages** (2015–2020)  
✅ Analyze **Covid-19 impact** (2019 vs 2020)  
✅ Show **monthly seasonal patterns** with boxplots  
✅ Save cleaned dataset for future use
