## 📚 Project Overview  

This project uses **real-world unemployment data** to:  
- Explore unemployment rate trends over time  
- Highlight the **economic effects of Covid-19**  
- Identify **seasonal patterns** in unemployment  
- Provide insights that could inform **economic and social policies**  

The project demonstrates the use of **Python for Data Analysis** with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

## 🚀 Features  

- Load unemployment data from **CSV**  
- Clean and preprocess data  
- Visualize **unemployment rate trends** over time  
- Compare **yearly averages** (2015–2020)  
- Analyze **Covid-19 impact** (2019 vs 2020)  
- Show **monthly seasonal patterns** with boxplots  
- Save cleaned dataset for future use

## 🧠 Concepts Covered  

- Data Cleaning (handling nulls, formatting dates)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Data Visualization (line plots, bar charts, boxplots)  
- Working with **time-series data**  
- Grouping and aggregating datasets  
- File handling with Pandas (`.csv`)

## 🎮 How to Use

When you run the script, it will:

- Show the first few rows of the dataset
- Display data info & summary
- Generate visualizations:
  - 📈 Line chart → Unemployment over time
  - 📊 Bar chart → Average unemployment by year
  - 📦 Boxplot → Monthly trends
- Print comparison of 2019 vs 2020 unemployment rates
- Save the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_unemployment.csv`
